For assessment details including instructions, and submission requirements refer to CSP451 GitHub and Assignment Instructions in <a href="#useful-resources">Useful Resources</a> section.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="assessment-criteria">Assessment Criteria<a href="#assessment-criteria" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Assessment Criteria" title="Direct link to Assessment Criteria">​</a></h2><p>Learning journey is structured around below Assessment Criteria, each designed to progressively build your skills and knowledge in the subject matter. Together, these assessments form a cohesive and structured learning experience, empowering you to achieve your learning objectives and emerge with tangible skills and accomplishments in the subject area.</p><ul><li>Integrity Badge</li><li>Checkpoints</li><li>Milestones</li><li>Demo Presentation</li><li>Final Evaluation</li><li>Budget Management</li></ul><p>Integrity Badge familiarizes you with <a href="https://www.senecapolytechnic.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seneca&#x27;s Integrity Policy</a> with an immerse and interactive tutorial. Ideally you must complete this before you access the course material. You will need to complete the training and submit your integrity badge. Refer to the Blackboard Portal for specific instructions.</p><p>The Checkpoints serve as pivotal deliverables where you&#x27;ll delve into specific topics, mastering essential concepts and techniques targeted in that Checkpoint. All Checkpoints are hands-on exercises, that requires you to complete the practical sections and answer questions that assess your learning. Check <a href="#checkpoints">Checkpoints</a> section for more information about this assessment criteria.</p><p>Additionally, the Milestones represent significant achievements throughout the course, marking key junctures where you&#x27;ll showcase your proficiency and apply your newfound expertise to real-world scenarios or projects. Check <a href="#milestones">Milestones</a> section for more information about this assessment criteria.</p><p>Another aspect of real-world projects in computer domain is the ability to demonstrate your skills or share know-how through Demo Presentations. Conventional theoretical or conceptual only presentations are gradually losing their appeal. Moreover, preparing for a hands-on demo enhances your learning, fosters deeper understanding and retention, and stimulates curiosity and critical thinking. You will be challenged to excel in the concept to the point that you can show case it practically and answer questions about it. Check <a href="#demo-presentation">Demo Presentation</a> section for more information about this assessment criteria.</p><p>Finally, your learning is assessed through the Final Evaluation, where you&#x27;ll synthesize and demonstrate your skills by tackling a complex challenge or developing a comprehensive solution that integrates the knowledge and techniques acquired throughout the course. Check <a href="#final-evaluation">Final Evaluation</a> section for more information about this assessment criteria.</p><p>Adherence to Cloud Resource Management is an important aspect of your learning in this course. You need to demonstrate that you are able to skillfully manage your cloud resources and work within your subscription constraints. Budget Management is the overarching concept but the scope of this assessment goes beyond and above budget management. Check <a href="#budget-management">Budget Management</a> section for more information about this assessment criteria.</p><p>Active participation in this course will not go unnoticed or unrewarded. Bonus Marks are to encourage you to take a proactive approach to this course. If you participate in class discussions, help with demo sessions and are willing to engage in class work to learn and help other students learn then you can earn Bonus Marks. Check <a href="#bonus-marks">Bonus Marks</a> section for more information about this assessment criteria.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="checkpoints">Checkpoints<a href="#checkpoints" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Checkpoints" title="Direct link to Checkpoints">​</a></h3><ul><li>Through the course you will compete 12 Checkpoint assignments.

Due dates and mark breakdown can be found in the Blackboard Portal.</li><li>Checkpoints are practical and as underlying infrastructures change, upgrade and are patched, the instructions must be updated, so Submission requirements often change. Check submission instructions frequently and be mindful of announcements. While major changes are usually announced through Blackboard Portal announcements, minor ones might go unnoticed. It is your responsibility to follow latest submission instructions for your work</li><li>Each Checkpoint is independent of the another but you probably need the knowledge and setup from previous Checkpoint to proceed to next, so if you fall behind, it is difficult to catch up.</li><li>You will have one week from the time Checkpoint instruction is posted until you submit it, for late submission policy, refer to <a href="#late-submission-policies">Late Submission Policies</a> section.</li><li>You have permission for one submission only, be mindful of what you submit.
