### What This Course is About

This course draws the student's attention to the issues and considerations related to the inter-connectivity and administration of various IT services in a cloud environment. Students learn to identify, isolate and subsequently overcome various installation and maintenance-related obstacles. It is expected that students will be proficient in remotely creating, administering and diagnosing an interconnected multi-server environment by course end. This course also introduces networking design topics, including development of a scalable and redundant network design in conjunction with disaster recovery planning. This course is devoted to group project work, designed to allow the students to apply the knowledge they have acquired in all of the subjects in the previous semesters.

### Accessing GitHub Organization

You will need a **GitHub** account to complete and submit the CSP451 Weekly Assignments. The GitHub account you use in this course must be linked to your _@myseneca.ca_ email. You cannot use personal or work GitHub for this course.

If you have not created a GitHub account using your Seneca email, you can wait until the first day of the class to set it up. If you already have created the GitHub account, make sure to follow instructions in ??? to update user-id and profile name as per course requirements.

Course GitHub Material codes and scripts are continuously updated, it is a good idea to add a watch on the repo and keep monitoring its updates.

### Class Demo - Bonus Marks
Throughout the semester, you will have multiple opportunities to present a topic that interests all students for a bonus mark. I would sometimes suggest the topic, but I am also open to your suggestions. The idea is to help you improve your presentation skills while helping us all learn new and useful topics.

### Presentation & Demo Guidelines

As we proceed with this practice, I will add more guidelines here, for now, I can think of:

1. Topics must be related to the course content and go beyond and above the class teaching.
2. If you like to contribute, directly message me in MS-Team and I will add your presentation and demo information here.
3. Once committed to a date, try not to change it. Even though this is for a Bonus Mark only, and I will not deduct marks if you miss, reschedule, or your work does not meet expectations, once you commit, take it seriously.
4. I will only be involved in the selection of topics and overall content, you have the freedom to choose how to create slides/demos to be effective.
5. I suggest you have a couple of presentation slides to review the concept followed by a real-time demo or recorded demo. The work must be your authentic work, you can't use someone else's demo.
6. Keep it short, I suggest targeting 15-20 minutes, beyond that you will lose interest and it is usually the time given to you to present your work in real-world scenarios. Learn to be concise.
