## Course Description

This course is designed to provide you with hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and deploying computer systems projects in Cloud platforms. Through a combination of tutorials, practical exercises, and real-world case studies, you will gain proficiency in leveraging cloud services for building scalable, reliable, and secure computer systems.

This is a project-based course that provides an opportunity for you to apply the knowledge you have acquired in all of the subjects in the previous semesters in multiple real-world projects focusing on the issues and considerations related to the interconnectivity and administration of various IT services in a cloud environment. You learn to identify, isolate, and solve problems that cloud architects and developers deal with in the real world. By the end of this course, you will be able to design, provision, troubleshoot and maintain virtual infrastructure.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain a better understanding of cloud computing principles and services.
- Design and implement reliable, robust, and secure computer systems projects in the cloud environment.
- Utilize monitoring and logging tools to ensure the performance and availability of infrastructure and service in the cloud environment.
- Design, provision and troubleshoot scalable, portable, and resilient solutions and containerized applications.
- Optimize costs by effectively managing cloud resources and understanding pricing models.

## Course Outline

This course is divided to three parts:

- Part One - Version Control Systems
- Part Two - Azure Computer Networking
- Part Three - Scalable, Portable, Resilient Design Patterns

### Part One - Version Control Systems

    - Overview of version control systems and their importance in software development.
    - Understanding GitHub, creating and managing repositories.
2. Git Branches:
    - Creating and switching between branches locally using Git.
    - Branching models, best practices for branching, and branch naming conventions.
3. Pull Requests:
    - Understanding pull requests and their role in code review and collaboration.
    - Creating, reviewing, and merging pull requests on GitHub.
4. Conflict Resolution:
    - Identifying and resolving merge conflicts in Git.
    - Strategies for handling conflicting changes in code files during merges.
5. GitHub Actions:
    - Introduction to GitHub Actions as a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tool.
    - Configuring workflows using YAML syntax to automate build, test, and deployment processes.
6. Case Studies and Real-World Applications:
    - Managing repositories, users, and permissions in GitHub Enterprise environments.
    - Best practices and lessons learned from successful GitHub workflows and deployments.

### Part Two - Azure Computer Networking

    - Understanding Azure VM principles and design considerations.
    - Creating, configuring, and managing VM instances using the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, and PowerShell.
2. Azure Networking Fundamentals:
    - Configuring virtual networks (VNets) and subnets in Azure.
    - Implementing network security groups (NSGs), peering, and Azure Route Tables.
3. Compute Engine Deployment Strategies:
    - Automated provisioning with Deployment Manager and Terraform.
    - High availability and fault tolerance strategies using managed instance groups and regional deployments.
4. Security and Compliance:
    - Best practices for securing Virtual Machines instances and networks.
    - Implementing network security services to filter and inspect network traffic at the network perimeter.
5. Monitoring, Logging, and Troubleshooting:
    - Utilizing Azure Monitor for monitoring VM performance metrics, logging, and diagnostics.
    - Diagnosing and troubleshooting common issues in Azure VM deployments.
6. Cost Management and Optimization:
    - Cost estimation and pricing models for Compute Engine resources.
    - Strategies for cost optimization, including rightsizing instances, utilizing preemptible VMs and leveraging sustained use discounts.
