## What is GitHub Discussions?

GitHub Discussions is a feature introduced by GitHub that enables individuals to have open conversations and discussions directly within the GitHub platform. It serves as a centralized space for users to ask questions, share ideas, provide feedback, and engage with others about the project.

> GitHub Discussions is a collaborative communication forum for the community around an open source or internal project. Discussions are for conversations that need to be transparent and accessible but do not need to be tracked on a project and are not related to code, unlike GitHub Issues. Discussions enable fluid, open conversation in a public forum. [1]

Key features of GitHub Discussions:

1. **Structured Conversations:** Discussions can be organized into categories or topics, making it easier for users to find relevant threads and participate in specific areas of interest.
2. **Rich Formatting:** Users can format their posts using Markdown, allowing for clear and well-structured communication. They can include code snippets, images, links, and other media to enhance their messages.
3. **Moderation Tools:** Project maintainers have control over discussions and can moderate them to ensure they remain constructive and on-topic. They can close or lock threads, mark answers as solutions, and manage user permissions.
4. **Integration with Issues and Pull Requests:** Discussions can be linked to issues and pull requests, providing context and allowing users to discuss specific topics related to the project's development.
5. **Community Engagement:** GitHub Discussions fosters community engagement by enabling users to interact directly with project maintainers, contributors, and other community members. It promotes transparency, collaboration, and knowledge sharing within the project community.

## GitHub Community Guidelines

> The primary purpose of the GitHub community is to collaborate on software projects. We are committed to maintaining a community where users are free to express themselves and challenge one another's ideas, both technical and otherwise. At the same time, users must remain respectful and allow space for others to contribute openly. To foster both a safe and productive environment, we encourage our community members to look to these guidelines to inform how they interact on our platform. Below, you’ll find some suggestions for how to have successful interactions as a valued member of the GitHub community.

> Be welcoming and open-minded - New users join our community each day. Some are well-established developers, while others are just beginning. Be open to other ideas and experience levels. Make room for opinions other than your own and be welcoming to new collaborators and those just getting started.

> Be respectful - Working in a collaborative environment means disagreements may happen. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Share thoughtful, constructive criticism and be courteous to those you interact with. If you’re unable to engage respectfully, consider taking a step back or using some of our moderation tools to de-escalate a tense situation.

> Be empathetic - GitHub is a global community with people from a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, many of which may not be your own. Try to put yourself in others’ shoes and understand their feelings before you address them. Do your best to help make GitHub a community where others feel safe to make contributions, participate in discussions, and share different ideas.
