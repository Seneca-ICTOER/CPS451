# GitHub Discussions

We will be using GitHub Discussions in the course repository: Azure-Project-Winter2024 from course organization: CSP451-ComputerSystemsProject. Always create discussion topics with meaningful titles that other students can use in their searches. Add proper tags, and include all details in the discussion body. A well-created, clear and concise topic will always get better attention. You can find the discussions page here: Azure-Project-Winter2024/discussions

This course uses GitHub Discussions for collaboration, issue resolution and technical resolutins.

GitHub Community Guidelines
https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines

The primary purpose of the GitHub community is to collaborate on software projects. We are committed to maintaining a community where users are free to express themselves and challenge one another's ideas, both technical and otherwise. At the same time, users must remain respectful and allow space for others to contribute openly. To foster both a safe and productive environment, we encourage our community members to look to these guidelines to inform how they interact on our platform. Below, you’ll find some suggestions for how to have successful interactions as a valued member of the GitHub community.

Be welcoming and open-minded - New users join our community each day. Some are well-established developers, while others are just beginning. Be open to other ideas and experience levels. Make room for opinions other than your own and be welcoming to new collaborators and those just getting started.
Be respectful - Working in a collaborative environment means disagreements may happen. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Share thoughtful, constructive criticism and be courteous to those you interact with. If you’re unable to engage respectfully, consider taking a step back or using some of our moderation tools to de-escalate a tense situation.
Be empathetic - GitHub is a global community with people from a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, many of which may not be your own. Try to put yourself in others’ shoes and understand their feelings before you address them. Do your best to help make GitHub a community where others feel safe to make contributions, participate in discussions, and share different ideas.
