## Onboarding GitHub Organization

![github-organization](/img/about/github_icon.png)

You need a GitHub account to complete and submit the CSP451 Weekly Assignments. The GitHub account you use in this course must be linked to your _@myseneca.ca_ email. You cannot use personal or work GitHub for this course.

If you have not created a GitHub account using your Seneca email, you can wait until the first day of the class to set it up. If you already have created the GitHub account, make sure to follow instructions in ??? to update user-id and profile name as per course requirements.

Course GitHub Material codes and scripts are continuously updated, it is a good idea to add a watch on the repo and keep monitoring its updates.
