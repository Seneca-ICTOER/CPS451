## Onboarding GitHub Organization

![github-organization](../../static/img/about/github_icon.png)

You need a GitHub account to submit most of the CSP451 Coursework. The GitHub account you use in this course must be linked to your _@myseneca.ca_ email. You cannot use personal or work GitHub Accounts for this course.

If you have not created a GitHub account using your Seneca email, you can wait until the first day of the class to set it up. If you already have created the GitHub account, make sure to follow the instructions in [Changing your GitHub username](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-user-account-settings/changing-your-github-username) to update GitHub username and profile name as per course requirements.

### GitHub Username and Profile Name

In this course, it's essential to adhere to the username and profile naming convention. This is because assignments may be marked using an automated marking tool that relies on your username and password from the "GitHub Account Username List" in the Blackboard portal. Ensuring the correct username is used is crucial to avoid any loss of marks.

"Your username follows the format `<student_number>-myseneca`, utilizing a hyphen `-` instead of an underscore `_`, and it's case-sensitive. Additionally, please ensure your profile name reflects your full name. As this is an academic course, it's important to maintain a professional profile, so refrain from choosing overly innovative or flashy profile names or photos.
