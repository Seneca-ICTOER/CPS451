## Assessment Summary

This page serves as a general overview providing an outline of the assessment types and criteria for the course. For more detailed information on specific assessments, including weightings, rubrics, and submission due dates refer to the Blackboard Portal. For assessment details including instructions, and submission requirements refer to CSP451 GitHub and Assignment Instructions in [Useful Resources](#useful-resources) section.

Learning journey is structured around **Checkpoints**, **Milestones**, **and **Final Evaluation**, each designed to progressively build your skills and knowledge in the subject matter. Together, these components form a cohesive and structured learning experience, empowering you to achieve your learning objectives and emerge with tangible skills and accomplishments in the subject area.

The Checkpoints serve as pivotal deliverables where you'll delve into specific topics, mastering essential concepts and techniques targeted in that Checkpoint. All Checkpoints are hands-on exercises, that requires you to complete the practical sections and answer questions that assess your learning.

Additionally, the Milestones represent significant achievements throughout the course, marking key junctures where you'll showcase your proficiency and apply your newfound expertise to real-world scenarios or projects.

Finally, your learning is assessed through the Final Evaluation, where you'll synthesize and demonstrate your skills by tackling a complex challenge or developing a comprehensive solution that integrates the knowledge and techniques acquired throughout the course.

## Assessment Criteria

The section describes types of assessment designed for this course and an overview of policies for marking them. For details of mark breakdown, refer to the Blackboard Portal. The link to the portal can be found in [Useful Resources](#useful-resources) section. Below is the list of assessment you will complete throughout this course:

- Integrity Badge
- Checkpoints
- Milestones
- Demo Presentation
- Final Evaluation
- Budget Management

### Integrity Badge

Ideally you must complete this before you access the course material. Refer to [Seneca's Integrity in Action module](https://teachingandlearning.senecapolytechnic.ca/forstudents/integrityinaction/) and reviews main topics. Refer to the Blackboard portal for submission requirements and details.

### Checkpoints

- Through the course you will compete 12 Checkpoint assignments. Each Checkpoint has a GitHub Submission component in form of a `README.md` file and a Blackboard Portal submission.Submission Instructions and Requirements are posted in Course GitHub Organization, links to which can be found in [GitHub Links](#github-links). Due dates and mark breakdown can be found in the Blackboard Portal.
- Checkpoints are practical and as underlying infrastructures change, upgrade and are patched, the instructions must be updated, so Submission requirements often change. Check submission instructions frequently and be mindful of announcements. While major changes are usually announced through Blackboard Portal announcements, minor ones might go unnoticed. It is your responsibility to follow latest submission instructions for your work
- Each Checkpoint is independent of the another but you probably need the knowledge and setup from previous Checkpoint to proceed to next, so if you fall behind, it is difficult to catch up.
- You will have one week from the time Checkpoint instruction is posted until you submit it, for late submission policy, refer to [Late Submission Policies](#late-submission-policies) section.
- You have permission for **ONE** submission only, be mindful of what you submit. If you have made a mistake in your submission, you can request a second submission but it must be requested before the due dates. Resubmission request after due dates cannot be accommodated.
- Checkpoints are individual assignments and you will need to work on them individually and complete them on your own. Feel free to discuss with other students and use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/CSP451/discussions) to resolve issues or seek help, but the work should be your authentic work and similarities beyond coincidence will be considered cheating and [Seneca's Integrity Policy](https://www.senecapolytechnic.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html) will be enforced.

### Milestones

- Through the course you will compete 3 Milestone assignments. Each Milestone is a **recorded video** of your working environment with demo of the required services.
- Milestones heavily rely on your Checkpoint assignment work. If you fall behind on Checkpoints, you will not be able to complete and submit Milestones on time, or you will struggle unnecessarily. Complete relevant Checkpoints before starting work on Milestones.
- You will have two weeks from the time Milestone instruction is posted until you submit it, for late submission policy, refer to [Late Submission Policies](#late-submission-policies) section.

- Demo Presentations will be distributed throughout the semester to avoid jam-packed presentation days towards end of the semester. You are advised to choose your presentation topic and date in the first two weeks of class. Doing the demo-presentation in the first four weeks of class gives you **2 Bonus Marks**.
