- Integrity Badge
- Checkpoints
- Milestones
- Demo Presentation
- Final Evaluation
- Budget Management

Integrity Badge familiarizes you with [Seneca's Integrity Policy](https://www.senecapolytechnic.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html) with an immerse and interactive tutorial. Ideally you must complete this before you access the course material. You will need to complete the training and submit your integrity badge.

All Checkpoints are hands-on exercises, that requires you to complete the practical sections and answer questions that assess your learning. Check [Checkpoints](#checkpoints) section for more information about this assessment criteria.

Additionally, the Milestones represent significant achievements throughout the course, marking key junctures where you'll showcase your proficiency and apply your newfound expertise to real-world scenarios or projects. Check [Milestones](#milestones) section for more information about this assessment criteria.

the Demo Presentation
Check [Demo Presentation](#demo-presentation) section for more information about this assessment criteria.

Finally, your learning is assessed through the Final Evaluation, where you'll synthesize and demonstrate your skills by tackling a complex challenge or developing a comprehensive solution that integrates the knowledge and techniques acquired throughout the course. Check [Final Evaluation](#final-evaluation) section for more information about this assessment criteria.

Adherence to Cloud Resource Management is an important aspect of your learning in this course.
