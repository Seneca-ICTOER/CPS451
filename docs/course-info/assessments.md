## Assessment Summary

This page serves as a general overview providing an outline of the assessment types and criteria for the course. For more detailed information on specific assessments, including weightings, rubrics, and submission due dates refer to the Blackboard Portal. For assessment details including instructions, and submission requirements refer to CSP451 GitHub and Assignment Instructions in [Useful Resources](#useful-resources) section.

Learning journey is structured around **Checkpoints**, **Milestones**, and **Final Evaluation**, each designed to progressively build your skills and knowledge in the subject matter. Together, these components form a cohesive and structured learning experience, empowering you to achieve your learning objectives and emerge with tangible skills and accomplishments in the subject area.

The Checkpoints serve as pivotal deliverables where you'll delve into specific topics, mastering essential concepts and techniques targeted in that Checkpoint. All Checkpoints are hands-on exercises, that requires you to complete the practical sections and answer questions that assess your learning.

Additionally, the Milestones represent significant achievements throughout the course, marking key junctures where you'll showcase your proficiency and apply your newfound expertise to real-world scenarios or projects.

Finally, your learning is assessed through the Final Evaluation, where you'll synthesize and demonstrate your skills by tackling a complex challenge or developing a comprehensive solution that integrates the knowledge and techniques acquired throughout the course.

## Assessment Criteria

The section describes types of assessment designed for this course and an overview of policies for marking them. For details of mark breakdown, refer to the Blackboard Portal. The link to the portal can be found in [Useful Resources](#useful-resources) section. Below is the list of assessment you will complete throughout this course:

- Integrity Badge
- Checkpoints
- Milestones
- Case-Study
- Final Evaluation
- Budget Management

### Integrity Badge

Ideally you must complete this before you access the course material. Refer to [Seneca's Integrity in Action module](https://teachingandlearning.senecapolytechnic.ca/forstudents/integrityinaction/) and reviews main topics in:

- Plagiarism
- Contract Cheating
- Impersonation
- Falsification
- Inappropriate Collaboration
- Duplicate Submission

Complete the module and capture a screenshot of your badge and submit the screenshot on the Blackboard Portal. Screenshot must include:

1. Who is the badge issued to
2. Name of badge
3. Issued by
4. Issued on

You can find an example badge in [here](https://seneca.sharepoint.com/:i:/s/CAACurriculum-CLO700IntroductiontoCloudInfrastructure/EZVwxvf9EmNEjIvRiYSMWf4BhexyPQuywv0BKJwqDBo6Gg?e=wztb6g).

### Checkpoints

Through the course you will compete 12 Checkpoint assignments. Below you can find more details and information about the Checkpoints:

1. Each Checkpoint has a GitHub Submission component in form of a `README.md` file and a Blackboard Portal submission.Submission Instructions and Requirements are posted in Course GitHub Organization, links to which can be found in [GitHub Links](#github-links). Due dates and mark breakdown can be found in the Blackboard Portal.
2. Checkpoints are practical and as underlying infrastructures change, upgrade and are patched, the instructions must be updated, so Submission requirements often change. Check submission instructions frequently and be mindful of announcements. While major changes are usually announced through Blackboard Portal announcements, minor ones might go unnoticed. It is your responsibility to follow latest submission instructions for your work
3. Each Checkpoint is independent of the another but you probably need the knowledge and setup from previous Checkpoint to proceed to next, so if you fall behind, it is difficult to catch up.
4. You will have one week from the time Checkpoint instruction is posted until you submit it, for late submission policy, refer to [Late Submission Policies](#late-submission-policies) section.
5. You have permission for **ONE** submission only, so take extra caution about what you submit. If you have made a mistake in your submission, you can request a second submission but it must be requested before the due dates. Resubmission request after due dates cannot be accommodated.
6. Checkpoints are individual assignments and you will need to work on them individually and complete them on your own. Feel free to discuss with other students and use Collaboration channel in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/CSP451/discussions) to resolve issues or seek help, but the work should be your authentic work and similarities beyond coincidence will be considered cheating and [Seneca's Copyright Policy](https://www.senecapolytechnic.ca/about/policies/copyright-policy.html) will be enforced.

ðŸ”¥ Most common mistake in Checkpoint submission is the hyperlink to your GitHub repository. **How can you do this correctly?**

### Milestones

Through the course you will compete 3 Milestone assignments. Below you can find more details and information about the Milestones:

1. Each Milestone is a **recorded video** of your working environment with demo of the required services.
2. Milestones heavily rely on your Checkpoint assignment work. If you fall behind on Checkpoints, you will not be able to complete and submit Milestones on time, or you will struggle unnecessarily. Complete relevant Checkpoints before starting work on Milestones.
3. You will have two weeks from the time Milestone instruction is posted until you submit it, for late submission policy, refer to [Late Submission Policies](#late-submission-policies) section.
4. You have permission for **ONE** submission only, so take extra caution about what you submit. If you have made a mistake in your submission, you can request a second submission but it must be requested before the due dates. Resubmission request after due dates cannot be accommodated.
5. Milestones are individual assignments and you will need to work on them individually and complete them on your own. Feel free to discuss with other students and use Collaboration channel in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/CSP451/discussions) to resolve issues or seek help, but the work should be your authentic work and similarities beyond coincidence will be considered cheating and [Seneca's Copyright Policy](https://www.senecapolytechnic.ca/about/policies/copyright-policy.html) will be enforced.

ðŸ”¥ Most common mistake in Milestone submission is the video file format. **How can you do this correctly?**

### Case-Study

Through the course you will compete 1 Case-Study assignments. Below you can find more details and information about the Case-Study:


Class Demo - Bonus Marks
Throughout the semester, you will have multiple opportunities to present a topic that interests all students for a bonus mark. I would sometimes suggest the topic, but I am also open to your suggestions. The idea is to help you improve your presentation skills while helping us all learn new and useful topics.

Presentation & Demo Guidelines
As we proceed with this practice, I will add more guidelines here, for now, I can think of:

Topics must be related to the course content and go beyond and above the class teaching.
If you like to contribute, directly message me in MS-Team and I will add your presentation and demo information here. 
Once committed to a date, try not to change it. Even though this is for a Bonus Mark only, and I will not deduct marks if you miss, reschedule, or your work does not meet expectations, once you commit, take it seriously.
I will only be involved in the selection of topics and overall content, you have the freedom to choose how to create slides/demos to be effective
I suggest you have a couple of presentation slides to review the concept followed by a real-time demo or recorded demo. The work must be your authentic work, you can't use someone else's demo
Keep it short, I suggest targeting 15-20 minutes, beyond that you will lose interest and it is usually the time given to you to present your work in real-world scenarios. Learn to be concise.

???

### Final Evaluation

At the end of the semester, you must complete 1 Final Evaluation which is in a form of Project. Below you can find more details and information about the Final Evaluation:

???
1. Depending on the class progress, you will have 24 to 48 hours to complete and submit your work after the instructions are posted
2. Due dates will be announced closer to the end of the semester
3. No repeats or late submissions would be granted.

### Budget Management

At the end of the semester, you will be assessed about how you effectively used Azure Resources. Below you can find more details and information about the Budget Management:

1. Budget Management is not the best representative of this assessment criteria, a better term would be **Adherence to Cloud Resource Management** which is an important aspect of your learning in this course. You need to demonstrate that you are able to skillfully manage your cloud resources and work within your subscription constraints.
2. Budget Management is marked binary, that means you either get all the marks or lose all the marks.for mark breakdown refer to the Blackboard Portal.
3. At the end of semester, the ITAS cloud team will assess your adherence to Cloud Resource Management and communicate with the professor which students did not comply with the requirement and will automatically miss **ALL** the mark for this assessment.
4. Follow below to receive a full mark:
   - Do not use the environment assigned to you in  this course for any other course or any other purposes
   - Safeguard your 2FA device, loss of your device will result in losing your 10%
   - Complete all Cloud related course work within the $100 credit given to you, you will need to constantly monitor your cost analysis and follow policy settings
   - Do not delete or modify the default setting

ðŸ”¥ Most common mistake that causes you to lose easy mark from Azure Budget Management is a resource you do not know you have like **_disk_** or **_public-ip_** or worst of all **_bastion_** which is super costly and eats up your budget before you know. **How can you do this correctly?**

### Bonus Marks

Active participation in this course will not go unnoticed or unrewarded. Bonus Marks are to encourage you to take a proactive approach to this course. Students who participate in class discussions, help with demo sessions and are willing to engage in class work to learn and help other students learn can earn up to 2 Bonus Marks in this course. Below you can find more details about what activities do / do not entitle you to Bonus Marks

1. You are frequently asked to participate in class demo sessions. Volunteering in this demo session, gives you an easy bonus mark.
2. Actively enganing in class discussins, answerign questins, 
3. Regular participation in GitHub Discussion Channels to help other students resolve issues gives you an easy bonus mark.

4. s and chennale in 

Any class activity will not entitle you to a bonus mark. I always announce in advance if the activity is attached to a bonus mark and at the end of the activity I will always advise you to submit your work here. Not every class activity can give you a bonus mark!
If in a 1-1 session I record your issue resolution, it will not entitle you to a bonus mark unless I specifically mention it and suggest you submit your work here.
If you participate in improving course material in GitHub, especially if you find bugs in the code or the markdown content, you are entitled to a reasonable bonus mark depending on the severity of the fix and the impact of your work. The improvements or suggestions must be an email with details of what is the issue and how to fix it. Screenshots are not accepted!
Sometimes, I will announce dates and topics where you can volunteer to do a presentation or demo of a concept that is related to the course and can be useful for all the students. You may use these opportunities to learn some challenging subjects by teaching them to other students.


Submission Guideline


Create a submission with your Full Name, Date, and Details of the activity that was completed. You must provide at least one paragraph with some information that reminds me of the details of the work.
If you have made coursework improvements, make sure to provide details of the email sent, you may also copy the email content in your submission
Do not submit any PDFs or Documents unless you are asked to do so.
Make a separate submission for each time you have done some work that entitles you to Bonus Marks.


I will not disclose the raw Bonus Marks, however, I will consider it in the final marks and if your work is impactful, I will make sure to nudge up your mark one level.
