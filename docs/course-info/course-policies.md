## What You Need to Know!

![what-you-need-to-know](/img/about/wynk_icon.jpg)

This is a project-based course that is designed to prepare you for your future careers by offering a dynamic and immersive learning experience. This course provides you with opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge gained throughout your academic journey to real-world scenarios, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity. By working on authentic projects, you gain hands-on experience in navigating complexities, collaborating with other students to solve problems, and managing project timelinesâ€”skills highly sought after by employers in various industries.

This course does **NOT** follow the regimented course-work addendum where you are frequently tested by quizzes, tests and exams, instead, you will be assigned challenging assignments that you need to research, analyze, and complete often requiring innovative solutions to unforeseeable challenges, thus enhancing your ability to adapt to the dynamics of the continuously evolving cloud computing industry. You will learn to stay abreast of emerging trends. The culmination of project-based assignments, throughout the course, will ultimately equip you with the confidence, competence, and practical expertise necessary to excel in your chosen career paths beyond the classroom.

There are **no formal teaching** sessions in this course. You are expected to explore and learn by completing assignments and coursework. During tutorials and classes, you will receive some hands-on examples of the challenging topics, however, be prepared to address the challenges yourself. You will be expected to complete most of the work individually, but at times for more complex projects you might be asked to work in a team, so be prepared to collaborate with your fellow students.

## Who should **NOT** take this course?

![who-should-not-take-this-course](/img/about/not_icon.jpg)

This course is ideal for students pursuing a career in computer science, information technology, or cloud computing. It is also beneficial if you are looking to enhance your expertise in cloud networking with focus on Azure technologies. Through this course, you can enhance your skills in cloud computing and Azure services and prepare yourself for Associate or Professional level certifications. However, you will have to learn by doing and problem-solving in multiple practical real-world projects.

If you are **NOT** ready to take on the challenges of practical projects, it may be advisable for you not to enroll in this course. Real-world projects demand a high level of commitment, critical thinking skills, and the ability to work effectively under pressure. Without these essential attributes, you may struggle to meet the course requirements and derive meaningful learning outcomes.

Moreover, participating in a course with project-based assignments requires you to actively engage in hands-on activities, collaborate with peers, and demonstrate initiative in tackling complex tasks. If you feel unprepared or lack the necessary skills and mindset to thrive in such an environment, it might be more beneficial for you to focus on building foundational knowledge and practical skills through prerequisite courses or additional training before attempting a course with real-world project components. Ultimately, taking on challenges beyond your current capabilities can lead to frustration and may impede overall academic and personal development. Therefore, it's important for you to assess their readiness and choose courses that align with your current skill level and learning objectives.
