## What You Need to Know!

![what-you-need-to-know](/img/about/wynk_icon.jpg)

This is a project-based course that is designed to prepare you for your future careers by offering a dynamic and immersive learning experience. This course provides you with opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge gained throughout your academic journey to real-world scenarios, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity. By working on authentic projects, you gain hands-on experience in navigating complexities, collaborating with other students to solve problems, and managing project timelines—skills highly sought after by employers in various industries. 

This course does not follow the regimented course-work addendum where you are frequently tested by quizzes, tests and exams, instead, you will be assigned challenging assignments that you need to research, analyze, and complete often requiring innovative solutions to unforeseeable challenges, thus enhancing your ability to adapt to the dynamics of the continuously evolving cloud computing industry. You will learn to stay abreast of emerging trends. The culmination of project-based assignments, throughout the course, will ultimately equip you with the confidence, competence, and practical expertise necessary to excel in your chosen career paths beyond the classroom.

There are no **formal teaching** sessions in this course. You are expected to explore and learn by completing assignments and coursework. During tutorials and classes, you will receive some hands-on examples of the challenging topics, however, be prepared to address the challenges yourself. You will be expected to complete most of the work individually, but at times for more complex projects you might be asked to work in a team, so be prepared to collaborate with your fellow students. 

## Who should **NOT** take this course?

![who-should-not-take-this-course](/img/about/not_icon.jpg)

If you are ready to take on the challenges of real-world projects, it may be advisable for you not to enroll in this course. Real-world projects demand a high level of commitment, problem-solving skills, and the ability to work effectively under pressure. Without these essential attributes, you may struggle to meet the course requirements and derive meaningful learning outcomes.

Moreover, participating in a course with project-based assignments requires you to actively engage in hands-on activities, collaborate with peers, and demonstrate initiative in tackling complex tasks. If you feel unprepared or lack the necessary skills and mindset to thrive in such an environment, it might be more beneficial for them to focus on building foundational knowledge and practical skills through prerequisite courses or additional training before attempting a course with real-world project components. Ultimately, taking on challenges beyond one's current capabilities can lead to frustration and may impede overall academic and personal development. Therefore, it's important for students to assess their readiness and choose courses that align with their current skill level and learning objectives.

Whenever there is publicly available learning material for your better understanding, it will be posted in Class Recording & Material. Keep monitoring it for updates.

### Prerequisites

![pre-requisites](/img/about/pre_icon.png)

This course is ideal for students pursuing a career in computer science, information technology, or cloud computing. It is also beneficial if you are looking to enhance your expertise in cloud networking and Azure technologies. Through this course, you can enhance your skills in cloud computing and Azure services and prepare yourself for Associate and Professional level certifications. However, you must basic cloud compcomputing utign and linux knowledge to excel in this course.

You are expected to have a preliminary understanding of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and have at least completed one basic project in a cloud environment. If you have never created a virtual machine before or are not comfortable with working with Linux commands, you need to do extra work to catch up.


You are also expected to be proficient in remotely creating, administering and diagnosing an interconnected multi-server environment. 

1. Basic knowledge of computer systems and networking.
2. Basic knowledge of computer networking concepts, including IP addressing, subnetting, and routing.
3. Familiarity with cloud computing fundamentals and Azure services is recommended but not mandatory.

### How to Ace this course

By meeting these success criteria, students will have the necessary skills and knowledge to design, deploy, and manage cloud network infrastructures effectively, preparing them for success in careers related to cloud computing and networking.

Understanding of Cloud Networking Concepts: Students should demonstrate a solid understanding of fundamental cloud networking concepts, including virtual networks, subnets, IP addressing, routing, and network security principles.
Proficiency in Cloud Platform Navigation: Students should be able to navigate and utilize cloud platforms such as Azure or AWS to deploy, configure, and manage network infrastructure components effectively.
Design and Implementation Skills: Students should be capable of designing and implementing network architectures in the cloud, considering factors such as scalability, availability, performance, and security.
Troubleshooting and Problem-Solving Abilities: Students should demonstrate the ability to diagnose and troubleshoot network issues in a cloud environment using appropriate tools and techniques.

Adaptability and Continuous Learning: Students should demonstrate adaptability to new technologies and methodologies in cloud networking and show a willingness to engage in continuous learning and professional development in the field.


 Keep failing, if you are not failing, it means you are not trying novel things
 If your script is running smoothly, and you do not have to bang your head to
the wall and curse the whole world, you are definitely going wrong
somewhere
 Treat ‘stackoverflow’ as bible and use other people’s code, but do not be
dumb! Add your flavor to your codes and be proud of your messy code
compared to a nice clean code that someone else has created
 Ask questions! Keep asking until you get an answer!
 Don’t mess up with coding savvy professors, I can run scripts that will find any
line copied from another source, cheating gets you a zero mark, and do not
test me there!

### Cheating and Plagiarism

- Don’t copy another person’s work (answers for tests, labs or assignments)
- Don’t let another person copy your work.
  - Penalties: Both students get zero for that particular assessment.
  - The incident is reported to the college's academic integrity counsel.
  - Academic Integrity Committee applies sanctions.
  - The comment goes on your transcript.
  - If the incident happens a second time, you could be kicked out of the program!
- Please visit the following link and make sure you understand what is considered cheating and an offence to academic integrity. For Students | Academic Integrity
- Also, make sure you understand what happens when a student is suspected of academic integrity violation. Academic Integrity Policy
- If it is suspected that you have committed academic integrity, it will be reported to the college following the procedure explained in the above link.
- In simple words, if you copy the answers of your fellow students, or your answers match each other or your answers are not unique/copied from the internet, I can safely assume that you cheated
