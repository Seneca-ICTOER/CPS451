## What You Need to Know!

![what-you-need-to-know](/img/about/wynk_icon.jpg)

This is a project-based course that is designed to prepare you for your future careers by offering a dynamic and immersive learning experience. This course provides you with opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge gained throughout your academic journey to real-world scenarios, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity. By working on authentic projects, you gain hands-on experience in navigating complexities, collaborating with other students to solve problems, and managing project timelinesâ€”skills highly sought after by employers in various industries.

This course does **NOT** follow the regimented course-work addendum where you are frequently tested by quizzes, tests and exams, instead, you will be assigned challenging assignments that you need to research, analyze, and complete often requiring innovative solutions to unforeseeable challenges, thus enhancing your ability to adapt to the dynamics of the continuously evolving cloud computing industry. You will learn to stay abreast of emerging trends. The culmination of project-based assignments, throughout the course, will ultimately equip you with the confidence, competence, and practical expertise necessary to excel in your chosen career paths beyond the classroom.

There are **no formal teaching** sessions in this course. You are expected to explore and learn by completing assignments and coursework. During tutorials and classes, you will receive some hands-on examples of the challenging topics, however, be prepared to address the challenges yourself. You will be expected to complete most of the work individually, but at times for more complex projects you might be asked to work in a team, so be prepared to collaborate with your fellow students.
