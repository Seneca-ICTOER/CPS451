## Introduction <a id="part-a-introduction"></a>

### Weekly Tutorials

- Online Tutorials are divided into INVESTIGATIONS that instruct students how to use the Unix/Linux OS.
- Checking programs (called scripts) are used to check if students correctly completed the tutorial:
  - If the student makes a mistake, feedback is provided for students to troubleshoot and correct their mistake and re-run the checking program.
  - Once the program is run and indicates success, marks are awarded to the student.
- Students MUST complete the weekly tutorial by Friday of the following week (by midnight) to get full marks (no exceptions).
- Students are responsible to know weekly tutorial due dates. Again, these are indicated in the ULI101 WIKI weekly schedule.
